# Triangle based technique to create a single number to represent a file

This is just an attempt to create a software that compresses text files by treating each set of 3 bytes as two sides of a triangle, and
 one angle between them. The idea is to calculate a number which is the third side's length. Though it is possible to have multiple
 combinations resulting in the same length of third side, it is true that one unique combination results in only one number. This
 python script tries to continuously compress data using this technique and finally come up with a single number representing the
 text file

# Uses:

I am not even sure if this technique is valid or not. Just thought of converting an idea to code. If someone finds a good use to this,
 it would make me happy. I someone has al-ready developed an advanced version of this, then request you to please share that with me, 
 so that I can learn from that


# TBD:

## Make the number of floating point digits (after the period) longer, by using python techniques
